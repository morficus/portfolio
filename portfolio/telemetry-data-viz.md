# Telemetry Data Visualization
The client was in the process of migrating their internal customer portal from ColdFusion to a modern platform.    
My responsibilities were only to create very specific components that would help his customers visualize historical data
collected from various field monitoring sensors.  

All charts were made with [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/) inside custom Vue components.

Visualization for multiple metrics with in a given time frame. As the user adjusted the date/time window, all charts would dynamically update
