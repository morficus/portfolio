# Simple As Can Be

This was an internal company application. Its main goal was to crowd-source ideas around cost-reduction or cost-savings.  

The user would would provide three data points:
* idea name
* brief description (less than 200 characters)
* areas of impact

From their the application would save the users entry to the database and add it to the main landing page in a series of "tiles". Clicking on one of the tiles would up it in a modal and provide a direct URL to the posting. 

Technologies used: Node.js for a simple REST API (only 3 endpoints), MongodB, Backbone.js and a highly customized in-house Bootstrap theme. Design and assets were provided the visual designer assigned to the project.
