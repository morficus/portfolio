# This is me

Iâ€™m a seasoned web developer with 12+ years of web tech experience and 9+ years of professional experience architecting 
and developing enterprise-class web application for multiple divisions  with in General Electric - specifically GE 
Capital and GE Aviation - mostly focused on the front-end.

I have shipped dozens of long-lived products, hundreds of projects and proof-of-concepts, many of which had thousands
 of active daily users. This has led me to become highly proficient when dealing with all things web related, especially
  front-end.
  
On top of an excellent track-record as an individual contributor, I  have experience with mentoring junior team members 
as well as leading small to medium teams of developers (6 to 8 team members).

During my 9+ years in Corporate America, I worked in a number of Agile software environments (scrum, Kanban, 
scrum-of-scrums, SAFe) with both co-located and remote teams. Actively participated and lead various agile ceremonies 
(daily stand-ups, sprint planning, review and retro, big-room planning)

I typically do side-work to help fuel my passion and grow my freelance portfolio. Building web apps and helping others 
are my passions, so I always strive to deliver high quality results.

## These are my tools 

My preferred tech stack is JavaScript from top to bottom. Here is a quick summary of what I typically use:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) for anything server-side or general systems related tooling
* [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) for building REST APIs
* [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html) for single-page applications
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/what-is-mongodb) or [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/about-us) as my data source, depending on the data needs
* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for unit tests, Postman for integration testing and [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for functional testing
